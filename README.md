# Suspect Game (in Python)  
> A light-hearted detective experience built in Python.

##  What is this?  
This is a simple and fun text-based game written entirely in Python. You assume the role of a detective, collect clues, make your accusations, and see if you can pick the right suspect.

##  Features  
- Console/terminal gameplay — no heavy graphics or dependencies.  
- Branching logic: your choices influence who the real suspect is (or who you accuse).  
- Clearly structured Python code — great for beginners to read, learn and modify.  
- Built to be extended: you can add more suspects, clues, or branching paths easily.

##  Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed on your system  
- Basic familiarity with running a `.py` script from terminal/cmd  

### How to Run  
1. Clone or download this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youngcoder45/Suspect-Game-In-Py.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Suspect-Game-In-Py
   ```
3. Run the game script:

   ```bash
   python SUSPECT.py
   ```
4. Follow on-screen prompts to collect clues and make your accusation!

## Why use this?

* A fun project to send to friends for a quick play-through.
* A compact codebase for studying basic game logic in Python (conditionals, loops, user input).
* A solid starting point for **you** (Aditya, our coder & space-lover) to build more elaborate games — maybe even space-themed next time!

##  How to Contribute

* Fork this repository.
* Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-extension`.
* Make your changes: add suspects, clues, new branching paths, maybe a GUI!
* Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add new suspect and clue branch"`.
* Push and open a pull-request.
